assembles the most probable
fragments based on the co-evolution
analysis of a multiple sequence alignment.

it makes
use of its formidable computing power
to manage truly deep neural networks
that identify co-evolutionary patterns in
protein sequences4 in terms of contact
distributions and angular restraints.
Furthermore, AlphaFold uses deep
learning to generate a protein-specific
statistical potential using a ‘learned
reference state’1, instead of a physical-based
reference state 5.
